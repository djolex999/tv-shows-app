# TV Shows App

TV Shows App is a React-based application that allows users to browse TV shows. It features functionalities like searching, pagination, and filtering by genres.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installing

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/djolex999/tv-shows-app.git


2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    cd tv-shows-app

3. **Install Dependencies**
    npm install
4. **Start the development server**
    npm start


Developing the TV Shows App task was a big learning curve for me as a new React developer. I started by watching a couple of YouTube tutorials ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH-pw1cv34E" and " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0J4395MKkc" + Udemy course videos via an account provided to me by my friend) which gave me a basic idea of what to do. But a lot of the time I was pretty lost grasping some concepts, with practice of course, it will improve..
I got help from ChatGPT often. It was like having a tutor that I could ask anything about React, from simple stuff like state and props to more confusing bits like pagination and filtering. I also read some of React's documentation and looked at different GitHub pages to see how others do things.
I used Prettier and ESLint(for the first time) to help with my code formatting and to catch errors, which was super helpful. Google Bard gave me some quick answers when I was stuck, too.
Making this app taught me a lot about React that I didn't know before. It felt great to see it all come together in the end, even though it was a bit of a struggle at times.


Will try to re-do the application in typeScript.
